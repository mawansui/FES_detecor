# Face, Eyes, Smile Detector

This repo contains a script that is capable of streaming video capture from a user's web cam, detecting the user's face, eyes on that face and whether the user is smiling or not. 

It is built using OpenCV python implementation and Haar cascades for face, eyes, and smile provided from the [OpenCV GitHub repo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
